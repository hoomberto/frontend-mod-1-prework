## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
It was definitely an adjustment - but one for the better. I have a tendency to plow through work in extended sessions, and sometimes that means my neck and shoulders get stiff from lack of movement. Incorporating the Pomodoro technique and taking regular breaks has made me noticeably less sore.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I was surprised by how much more determined I was to finish the initial tasks I set my intentions on. I think the conscious act of deciding on a goal and seeing those intentions written out and set up around me (list of tasks and timer set) really helped to keep me focused. I did have to adjust the length between breaks - I think 35-40 minutes vs. the recommended 25 work best for me.   

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is a data type JavaScript utilizes that stores its data in key-value pairs vs. storing them in an ordered list.
While both store data/lists of data, the information in an array is typically accessed by calling on a relevant index, whereas objects can use strings to get data by way of dot notation.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  An array, because there's only one dimension of data.
  * List of states and their capitals
  An object, because there's more than one dimension of data that is stored (states AND their capitals)
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  An array, because the list is confined to one dimension of data (things to pack)
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  An array, because the list is confined to one dimension of data (names of Instagram accounts I follow)
  * List of student names and their cohort
  An object, because there's more than one dimension of data (student names AND their cohort)
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  An object, because there's more than one dimension of data (ingredients AND their amount)
  * All my favorite restaurants
  An array, because the list is confined to one dimension of data (all my favorite restaurants).

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? 

Anything that has its own term that exists on social media - a "post", a "comment", a "profile". There are series of objects that make up most of the interfaces that we use in web applications, and I'd imagine more of these elements are treated as objects as the inclusion of metadata increases.

newPost would have an author, content, number of likes, and comments. A comment would have an author, content, number of likes, and replies. Metadata relating to both could include the time stamp and the origin of the IP address from where the post or comments were made.  

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

What would it look like to incorporate conditionals into classes/objects?
The material up to now involves information that is passed initially through code - I'd imagine classes/objects can be manipulated in the same way when provided user input. Are there any differences between these two methods besides how the data is passed?
