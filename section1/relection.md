## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

Medium acount for SuperLearner article is under investigation or was found in violation of the Medium Rules.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Number - The number data type holds integers or floats - integers represent numerical data without a decimal, whereas floats represent numbers with decimals. Numbers can also be negative.

Strings - Denoted with single or double quotes, strings are used to store textual data.

Boolean - This data type can describe properties either in True or False, or through comparison by way of different operators ( >, <, >=, <=, !=)

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

I would assign the string to a variable, then log that variable to the console.

var hello = "Hello World!";
console.log(hello);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Double backslashes indicate comments in a JavaScript file - they are used for annotating code, explaining what certain
snippets or portions do, and making it easier to skim or understand the purpose of the code/the reasoning or ideas behind it.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

var pledge_of_allegiance = "I pledge allegiance to the flag..."

If you were a computer going to class, instead of saying the pledge of allegiance word for word every morning, you could have all
the words put into a container, in this case a container called a string, and just say the name of that container instead.

That's what a variable is. It lets you hold a lot of information in one place and use it as many times as you need.

It's a term that describes a container for information that you assign a name. This container can hold
different kinds of information, such as strings, integers, booleans, arrays, and objects.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Three variables that are probably used would be:
- loggedIn (boolean), which would determine whether or not a user is logged in
- username (string), which would hold/display a username, and
- trialExpiresIn (integer), which would hold the number of days until a free trial expires.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is a programming term for adding, or joining together, strings or other data types. Instead of writing out static
strings, concatenation allows for a greater compression of information by being able to join variables together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
Automated messages probably rely on concatenation - having a pre-written message and inputting the variables for first and last names, variables for the number of months or years since variable for an event happened.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Is type coercion a deeper property of JavaScript I need to know more about, or does it only apply to string concatenation?

Interpolation seems all around more useful and easier to use than concatenation - are there any instances where concatenation should
be used instead of interpolation?
