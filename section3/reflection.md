## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I liked the SMART acronym provided by the article for learning - setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals to learn better. I also found the whole premise of applying a growth mindset to programming to be an optimistic one. The only thing that limits someone to what they can achieve with code is their own understanding and experience with it. Like the article said, many of the problems involved with coding can boil down to a matter of pushing just a bit beyond what's already known to tackle something new. With this in mind, incremental growth can steadily be achieved over time.   

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I try to frame as many things as I can in my life around a growth mindset - like Carmen mentioned in the video, life is very much a learning experience and I aim to be a lifelong student. I don't subscribe to the idea that my capabilities are static, effort and experience can yield incremental growth over time. Having spent over 10 years and well over 10,000 hours developing my personal photography, I'm fairly familiar with the process of getting good at something - you have to be pretty bad at it to begin with, and imposter syndrome is easier to experience than satisfaction with the craft at first.

That being said, there are still ways in which I do not demonstrate a growth mindset. The article brings up the points that making mistakes and not being afraid to seek help are essential to learning. I was raised to prioritize self-sufficiency over many other things, so these two qualities have always been daunting to me, in some way or another. However, now that I've gone through the Mod 0 course and experienced the sessions and various group activities, I'm learning how coding seems to fit somewhere entirely new in my life; being wrong or not knowing something isn't a frustrating thing so much as it is exciting, there's a thrill with understanding a new concept and being able to piece it together with something I already know.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Arrays are probably used in activity feeds (holding the value for each activity in a list), lists for menu items, arrays for user databases (which could hold key:value pairs for each user),

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a built-in function that's native to the programming language which allows for actions, calculations, and manipulations to be performed on an array or array-like object.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is used to perform a certain action or set of actions over a length of time, for n-number of times. It can be used to iterate through an array, or can be utilized to continuously run as long as a conditional is being met.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

You have a fresh loaf of bread and all the supplies you need to make a sandwich. If you wanted to have your computer make as many sandwiches as you could make using all the bread you had available, you would tell it "for as many pairs of bread slices I have (because a sandwich needs two slices): take a pair of bread slices, add peanut butter, add jelly, set the sandwich aside, then do the same thing to the next pair of bread slices" until there was no more bread to use. This same loop would work with 1 loaf of bread or 100 loaves of bread. 

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I saw the arrow function in the MDN documentation for array methods and found them fascinating, it reminds me of list comprehensions for Python. How often can I utilize arrow functions? Will we be learning about them? Speaking of, the *this* keyword is one I'm still trying wrap my head around, and one I'm hoping we'll cover in more detail.
